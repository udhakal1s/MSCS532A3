This project explores two major concepts. Randomized Quick sort vs Deterministic quicksort and hashing with chaining. The part compares how both the Randomized Quick sort and the Deterministic quicksort algorithm perform on different kinds of data, like sorted data, reverse data, random data, and repeated data. From the result, we saw randomized quicksort performs consistently close to O (n log n) while deterministic quicksort degrades to O(nÂ²) for sorted and reverse datasets. For the second part, hashing with chaining, the implementation successfully supports insert, search, and delete. For running both the implementation, I use Visual Studio Code and compile the file to getthe  output.
